# ShoppingListStore
About this shopping list store, I will implement a shopping list server. A client will connect to the server and perform various tasks related to shopping lists, including:

- Creating a new user with a username and password
- Adding an item to a user's shopping list (requires authentication)
- Removing an item from a user's shopping list (requires authentication)
- Displaying a user's shopping list (requires authentication)
- Clearing all shopping lists and users
- Shutting down the server
